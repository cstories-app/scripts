## `openai` R package

* [R Wrapper for OpenAI API â€¢ openai](https://irudnyts.github.io/openai/)

```{r}
librarian::shelf(
  jsonlite, listviewer, irudnyts/openai,
  quiet = T)

api_key_txt <- "/Users/bbest/My Drive/private/openai.com_api-key_ben@ecoquants.com.txt"

Sys.setenv(OPENAI_API_KEY = readLines(api_key_txt))
# Sys.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")

a1_json <- "data/openai/a1.json"
if (!file.exists(a1_json)){
  a1 <- create_completion(
    engine_id = "text-davinci-003",
    prompt = "What are the main marine energy applications?")
  write_json(a1, a1_json)
}
a1 <- read_json(a1_json)

# show results
jsonedit(a1)

## OpenAI Playground

What are the main marine energy applications?

  1. Tidal energy: Generating electricity from the ebb and flow of ocean tides.
  2. Wave energy: Generating electricity from the movement of ocean waves.
  3. Offshore wind energy: Generating electricity from the wind energy offshore.
  4. Ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC): Generating electricity from the temperature difference between the surface and deep ocean waters.
  5. Ocean current energy: Generating electricity from the movement of ocean currents.
  6. Salinity gradient energy: Generating electricity from the difference in salinity between two bodies of water.
  7. Marine hydrokinetic energy: Generating electricity from the movement of marine life, such as fish and marine mammals.
